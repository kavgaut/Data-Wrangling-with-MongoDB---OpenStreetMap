Map Area: San Jose, California, USAhttps://s3.amazonaws.com/metro-extracts.mapzen.com/san-jose_california.osm.bz2San Jose, California: As the hub of Silicon Valley, San Jos√© is a popular destination for tourists and business travelers. Visitors find many amenities in the City's revitalized downtown area including fine accommodations and world class restaurants and shops. 

A few reasons why this area is interesting to me are:
1. I live here and i was interested to draw more insights about this place from the OSM data in order to relate to some of them
2. The are numerous number of multi cuisine restaurants and a mixture of all ethnicities and as I had expected, it was good to draw conclusions based on different ethnicities and cultures.
